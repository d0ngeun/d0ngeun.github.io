# What is "Peanut Os"
Its a small peanut size operating system taken inspiration from <a class="link" href="google.com">this</a>, <a class="link" href="google.com">this</a>, and <a class="link" href="google.com">that</a>.  
It's more of a learning and skill excercise for myself, but I also hope to share the operating system knowledge i've gained along the way.  
Some really great resources for OS development are linked below as a <a class="link" href="#resources">resource</a>
